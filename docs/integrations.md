# Integration Playbook

Document any external systems an agent depends on. Capture:

- Required environment variables and where to obtain credentials.
- Sandbox or staging endpoints for verification.
- Rate limits, quotas, and retry strategies.
- Manual validation steps or example transcripts.

Append sections as new services are introduced so automated agents can replay the setup end-to-end.
